## Web-CAT Submission Energy

The submission energy bar is a new feature that has been added to Web-CAT to
aid to students.  This page helps outline some of the questions you may have,
as well as some of the background with the energy bar.  If you have additional
questions, feel free to post them on Piazza.  We will update this FAQ over time.


### How does it work?

For each assignment, you have an _energy bar_ that holds up to 3 units of
submission energy.  Each time you submit to Web-CAT, one unit of energy is
used.  Your bar will then regenerate energy at a rate of 1 unit per hour until
it is full again.  If your energy runs out, you cannot submit to Web-CAT
again until another unit of energy is regenerated.


### Help! The deadline is approaching and I'm out of energy!

Lack of energy won't prevent you from submitting your final work
before the deadline.  If you run out of energy and your next unit won't
regenerate until after the deadline, don't worry--Web-CAT will allow you
to submit your work without energy and process it immediately, until the 
deadline is reached.  Simply put, if you submit within an hour of the deadline,
Web-CAT won't "lock you out" of submitting, even if you have no energy left.


### What happens if I submit, but have no energy?

If your next unit of energy won't regenerate until after the due deadline,
your submission will be processed immediately (see above).

Otherwise, if you are submitting through the web interface, you cannot submit
if you have no energy.

If you are submitting from inside your IDE, the results page you receive will
indicate you're out of energy and ask you to wait until your energy
regenerates.

In either case, simply wait until the next unit of submission energy
regenerates to resubmit.


### Where did the idea come from?

The submission energy bar was inspired by many mobile games (like Clash of
Clans) in which the user is given a limit on the number of actions they can
perform, but the limit replenishes over time.  Research has shown that such
systems have encouraged gamers to change their behavior by revisiting tasks
periodically over a longer period of time instead of binge-playing in just
one or two sittings.

It turns out that on _programming assignments_, research
has shown that starting earlier and working over more work sessions leads
individuals to earn higher scores than they would if they binge-programmed in
one or two marathon sessions just before the deadline. Binge programming at
the last minute results in lower scores for most students. Thus, the submission
energy bar was born.


### Why was the energy bar developed?

There are several reasons the energy bar helps students...

1.  **Help students get better grades.**  If you start earlier, you will have
    the opportunity to make more submissions and get more feedback over a
    longer period of time.  Earlier
    feedback gives you more time to ask questions in class, visit office hours,
    or participate in discussions in class forums.  If you get stuck, you have
    more time to get help becoming unstuck. And finally, it allows you
    to recognize opportunities to apply what you hear in class to your
    assignments.  If, on the other hand, you wait until the last minute to
    get started, often there isn't time to seek help.

2.  **Encourage students to think about their changes.** When you are
    developing your solution and come across a problem, some students fall
    back on a "guess and check" strategy where they make small changes and
    resubmit their work, sometimes leading to a very large number of Web-CAT
    submissions in order to resolve the issues.  Unfortunately, research
    indicates that this pattern isn't helpful for learning, because the
    student may not understand the source of the problem, or may not understand
    the effects of the changes they are trying out.  The recharge rate on
    submission energy encourages students to think through the meaning of
    any change, to double-check changes locally first, and to resolve
    multiple errors at a time, rather than trying out guesses with submission
    after submission.  When you think harder about the effects of your
    changes, and confirm for yourself they do what you want before you
    submit, you learn more and learn faster.

3.  **Reduces Web-CAT congestion.** Submission energy keeps other students
    from overloading Web-CAT when you need to get feedback on your own
    submissions, too.


### What strategies can I apply to get the most out of the energy bar?

-   **Start working earlier.** By working earlier, you will get the opportunity
    to make more submissions.  As you work earlier, you can recognize how labs,
    lecture, and other assignments provide clues on how to complete the
    assignments.  It's hard to recognize these if you wait until the last
    minute.

-   **Plan out how you spend your time.** Think explicitly about when you want
    to schedule your programming sessions into your weekly schedule, so you
    are more deliberate about spreading your effort out instead of focusing
    on a small number of marathon programming sessions or an all-nighter.

-   **Make the most of each submission.** If Web-CAT indicated you have
    several errors or issues, try to fix as many as possible before making a
    new submission.  Try to fix or add test cases.  Basically, make smart
    submissions and think through the consequences of the changes you
    make--because that's how you exercise your skills and learn how to improve.
